## _Tomás Balducchi_

I’m a _Frontend Engineer_ with a strong _product-oriented_ mindset.

I’m specialized in **Angular**, although I’ve worked with other frameworks. Like _React, Ionic and Astro_

I have **over eight years of experience** in the IT sector. I have experience serving as a technical lead in frontend development, where I’ve provided guidance to junior developers and interns, helping them take their first steps in the industry.

I am passionate about building user-focused solutions while maintaining high-quality code standards.

Plus, I like to get involved in all stages of development, and contribute to creating great products. That's why I also occasionally work with technologies not related to the Frontend, such as _.Net, NodeJS, MySQL, MongoDB_ among others.

I like to find my place in each team, which can vary depending on the context and how the team is made up. And from there I contribute everything I have learned. Both providing ideas to improve or how to build a product, and helping colleagues by sharing the knowledge I have acquired.

**Contact** info below, and please check the **resume page** for details.

# I like to be constantly learning, so I try to

# keep up to date on technologies and their

# evolution.

# I'm often creative when it comes to solving

# problems, but when I'm stuck, I'm not shy

# about asking team members for help.

# I've found that I really enjoy helping my

# peers, whether it's those with similar

# experience or perhaps guiding a new team

# member who doesn't have a lot of developer

# experience through their first steps.

# I enjoy being involved in all stages of the

# project, and I feel motivated when I am

# allowed to do so.
